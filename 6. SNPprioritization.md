# SNP prioritization

After GWAS analysis, the SNPs with most significant association p-value (<0.01) were extracted. Those SNPs are organised in blocks, so the next step was to identify those blocks in order to find the most significant SNP of each block. The SNP selected in each block was according to the information from the SNPeff analysis (and the number of NA values).



## 1. Significant SNP extraction  
This was performed in R with the files resulting from the GAPIT GWAS analysis:
**In R**

    # Load file
    FarmCPU_r <- read.table('GAPIT.FarmCPU.BMI.GWAS.Results.csv', sep = ',', header = T)
    
    # Extract significant SNPs
    mySNPs <- FarmCPU_r[(FarmCPU_r$P.value<0.01),]$SNP

    # Write snps to text file to extract using PLINK
    write.table(mySNPs, file='significantSNPs.txt', quote=FALSE, sep="\n", col.names = F, row.names = FALSE)

**In bash shell**
