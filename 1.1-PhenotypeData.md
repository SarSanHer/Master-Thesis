# Phenotype Data Analysis

After the phenotypic trait's data had been homogenized and transformed to numerical or categorical (depending on the case), the data was analysed to determine the distribution of the numerical traits, and to find the relevant covariates to the Body Mass Index (using GLM). Lastly, the data was trasformed to a GAPIT suitable format. 

The analyses were performed in R, and the script can be found in this GitHub repository under the name ```4.1-PhenotypeData```
