# Epigenetics

This file contains the details on the epigenetics analysis in the project. The raw data consisted in excel tables, and the data was analysed using [Champ](https://github.com/YuanTian1991/ChAMP), an R package that was installed using:

    git clone https://github.com/YuanTian1991/ChAMP.git
    R CMD INSTALL ChAMP
    
More information on the tool ChAMP can be found in this [publication](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/24/3982/4082274). The analyses run using this tool can be found in the R script "epigenetics.R" in this repository.
