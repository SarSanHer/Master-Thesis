# Master-Thesis
This repository contains the scripts and command pipelines used in the Master Thesis Project: *Identification of genetic and epigenetic varianst associated to the severity of Rheumatoid Arthritis*.

This project aims to find genetic traits associated to RA patients with high BMI so to gain knowledge in regards to the suspected different etiology of the disease in this group of patients, and ultimately contribute to the assessment of the relation between different etiopathologies and treatment response, which will improve RA patientsâ€™ lives as well as save money to the public healthcare system. In order to achieve this goal, genetic and epigenetic data will be analysed, as this is a complex disease in which the environment plays a critical role. In the genetic analysis, the objective will be to obtain a small set of 15-30 SNPs that are significantly associated to the disease, and to look into the underlaying mechanisms in which the genes affected are involved so to give a preliminary overview of the possibly different etiopathology in RA patients with high BMI. In the epigenetic analysis, the focus will be in finding epigenetic markers associated to the phenotypic traits in RA patients as a head start for further analysis in future studies.
