# Master-Thesis
This repository contains the scripts and command pipelines used in the Master Thesis Project: *Identification of genetic and epigenetic varianst associated to the severity of Rheumatoid Arthritis*.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory complex disease of unknown etiology, that is affected by genetic, epigenetic, environmental and stochastic factors. Over the last few years, particular attention has been given to the relation between high body mass index (BMI) and RAâ€™s susceptibility and treatment response. RA patients of high BMI show the one of the worst disease prognosis and response to treatment; and yet, the role of BMI in RA is poorly understood. Several studies have monitored the effect of a higher body mass on response to specific drugs, and others have tried to define genetic and associated to BMI, and to RA; but the biomarkers linked to RA patients of high BMI and their response to treatment are still to be defined. In this Master's Theris, the genetic and epigenetic data of overweight and obese RA patients will be analysed in order to find significant biomarkers linked to BMI. In addition, it will be it will be hypothesized that RA patients of high BMI belong to an entirely different etiopathology, with different triggering factors and underlying pathways that predict a different treatment response.
  
The scripts and commands collected in this repository, document the data treatment and analyses carried out in the way to achieve this goal. The respository documents the different analyses with the same name that the Materials & Methods section of the thesis has as subsection names, and ordered in the order n which they appear in the text:

  1.1 Phenotype data (distributions and GLMs)
  1.2 Population stratification
  2.1 Data analysis (prevalence of relevant SNPs properties in the data)
  2.2 Quality control (filtering)
  2.3 Imputation (and genotype.R script for imputation results treatment)
  2.4 SNPeff (functional annotation of SNPs)
  3.1 GWAS (data preparation)
  3.2 GAPIT (commands used for GWAS aalysis using GAPIP tool)
  4 SNP prioritization
  4.a Best SNP (function-based prioritization of haplotype block's SNPs)
  4.b Machine learning (selection of most important SNPs with machine learning prioritization)
  5. Epigenetics
